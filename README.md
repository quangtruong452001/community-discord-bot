A Discord bot to support Community team collect feedbacks from players about their gameâ€™s experience  
You can add the bot to your Discord server to test: [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1183743322490142750&permissions=1084479765568&scope=bot) </br>

- `/ping`: should return `Pong!` if the bot is working
- `/feedback <options>` receive the feeback and send it to `community-feedback-server` the return message "Thanks for reaching out! We'll be passing this along to the team directly! Good luck playing the game!"
